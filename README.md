## Technical Details

### Encryption
Fallout Shelter save files use AES-CBC encryption with:
- **Key**: `a7c2f3f367a2e2e2f0f2b6b1b3b4b5b6b7b8b9babbbcbdbebfc0c1c2c3c4c5c6c7` (hex)
- **IV**: `7475383967656A693334307438397532` (hex)
- **Mode**: CBC with PKCS7 padding
- **Encoding**: Base64

### Save Structure
The decrypted save file is a JSON object containing:
- `vault.storage.resources` - Resource amounts (caps, food, water, etc.)
- `vault.VaultName` - Vault name
- `vault.VaultMode` - Game mode (Normal/Survival)
- `dwellers.dwellers` - Array of dweller data
- And much more...
